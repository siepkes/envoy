# Envoy SmartOS / Illumos / Solaris port

**(Scroll down for original Envoy readme.md)**

This repo contains a SmartOS port for Envoy. It will probably also work on Solaris though it will probably require modifications since we assume the use of pkgsrc.

To build this Envoy port you need Bazel. This requires a SmartOS / Illumos / Solaris port of Bazel since Bazel does not natively support these platforms. See the [bazel-smartos](https://github.com/siepkes/bazel-smartos) repo for a SmartOS port. My intention being to properly upstream the thing but that takes some work... Feel free to reach out to me if you encounter any issues.

## Running Envoy on SmartOS

**WARNING: When running set the environmental variable `EVENT_NOEVPORT=yes`.**

Envoy uses libevent which uses event ports on Illumos (the native non-blocking IO implementation on Illumos). For some reason when using event ports libevent starts making a massive number of syscalls (as many as the CPU limits allow). Therefor we disable the event ports implementation in libevent for now.

```
$ export EVENT_NOEVPORT=yes
$ ./envoy-static --disable-hot-restart -c ./config.yaml
```

## Building Envoy on SmartOS

Create a SmartOS container (`joyent` brand if your on Joyent's public cloud / Triton). Steps below are performed on a container running the `base-64` image version `20.2.0` (`ad6f47f2-c691-11ea-a6a5-cf0776f07bb7`). 

The following things are good to know:

* As stated in the [bazel-smartos](https://github.com/siepkes/bazel-smartos) repo the Bazel binary depends on a specific GCC version (due to hardcoded version in some paths). 
* When using `export NUM_CPUS=2` you probably require at least 16GB of RAM and 32 GB of swap in your VM to build Envoy. Trying to build with an 8GB VM led to an `ld: fatal: mmap anon failed: Resource temporarily unavailable` error while linking in my case. You can experiment with lowering `NUM_CPUS` if you run in to memory problems.

Install required build packages. Envoy makes use of modern C++ so will only work with a modern C++ compiler.

```
$ pkgin install go ninja-build gcc7 git-base zip unzip openjdk8 libtool cmake automake ninja-build autoconf gmake py37-expat
```

NOTE: We are assuming Python 3.7 is used in the platform (hence the `py37-expat` package). When bumping Triton image version verify the package Python version.

Configure the build environment:
```
# Needed to prevent a CPU detection algorithm from going awry.
$ export NUM_CPUS=1
$ git clone https://github.com/siepkes/envoy-smartos.git
```

Build Envoy:
```
$ cd envoy-smartos
$ bazel build -c opt --jobs=4 --define hot_restart=disabled --package_path %workspace%:/root/envoy-smartos/ //source/exe:envoy-static
```

To troubleshoot build issues Bazel can be made more talkative with the following options:

```
$ bazel --client_debug build -c dbg --jobs=4 --define hot_restart=disabled --sandbox_debug --verbose_failures --toolchain_resolution_debug --package_path %workspace%:/root/envoy-smartos/ //source/exe:envoy-static
```

This will result in a statically linked binary of Envoy in `./bazel-bin/source/exe/envoy-static`. 

The binary will include debug symbols which you can strip to bring down the size of the binary substantially. Beware that this will make the backtrace library unusable (ie. stacktraces become hard to read):

```
$ strip --strip-debug ./bazel-bin/source/exe/envoy-static
```

## Known issues / TODO's / Remarks

Below is a list of known issues of this port. These are mostly open issues because they represent functionality I didn't need right away and stood in the way of doing a sucessful build. I'm obviously open to any PR / help anyone can offer though!

### Make event ports work

Currently we disable event ports by using the environmental variable `EVENT_NOEVPORT=yes`. When using event ports Envoy (or more likely libevent) starts making a massive number of syscalls. I'm guessing this is because some (event) loop in libevent is going haywire. Probably need to take a look at `libevent_scheduler.cc` how libevent is configured.

### Final binary requires GCC7 package

Due to the way the linking is currently configured the final Envoy binary requires the `gcc7` package to be installed in the container:

```
$ ldd bazel-bin/source/exe/envoy-static
        librt.so.1 =>    /lib/64/librt.so.1
        libdl.so.1 =>    /lib/64/libdl.so.1
        libpthread.so.1 =>       /lib/64/libpthread.so.1
        libm.so.2 =>     /lib/64/libm.so.2
        libstdc++.so.6 =>        /opt/local/gcc7//lib/amd64/libstdc++.so.6
        libxnet.so.1 =>  /lib/64/libxnet.so.1
        libsocket.so.1 =>        /lib/64/libsocket.so.1
        libnsl.so.1 =>   /lib/64/libnsl.so.1
        libgcc_s.so.1 =>         /opt/local/gcc7//lib/amd64/libgcc_s.so.1
        libc.so.1 =>     /lib/64/libc.so.1
        libmp.so.2 =>    /lib/64/libmp.so.2
        libmd.so.1 =>    /lib/64/libmd.so.1
```

### Get entire test suite to run

Headline covers it.

```
$ export JAVA_HOME="/opt/local/java/openjdk8"
$ bazel test --host_javabase=@local_jdk//:jdk //test/... 
```

### Hot restart disabled

Currently we pass `--define hot_restart=disabled` when building to disable Hot restart (ie. restart Envoy without client connections being closed). Hot restart is disabled because it didn't work without modifications and I didn't have a need for it. 

#### py37-expat package requirement.

The `py37-expat` package must be installed otherwise the build dies with the output below. I (@siepkes) think this might actually be a bug in upstream (requiring manual install of the package)?

```
